I recently published my first article on the http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/project-hendrix.html[_``Adobe Developer Connection / Flex Developer Center''_]. http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/project-hendrix.html[This article] provides a glimpse under the hood and a look at the architecture of a call center Customer Experience Management solution (code named Hendrix).

In a future article, I plan to detail and demonstrate Hendrix software factory techniques, but in the meanwhile, if you feel I should provide greater details on another specific aspect of this project (for example, Java / LCDS / SAP integration, Computer Telephony Integration , security, modularity, or Flex multiscreen support) let me know.
