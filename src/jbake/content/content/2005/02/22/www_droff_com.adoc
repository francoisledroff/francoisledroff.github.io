I finally bought it : http://www.droff.com[droff.com] is mine. I bought it through this small parisian company: gandy. The ultimate goal is still to have my own server running somewhere and hosting stuff like: francois.le.droff.com or le.droff.com.

would be great to have the e.mail addresses as well: francois@le.droff.com. well…I’ve got 2 years !! … we’ll see
