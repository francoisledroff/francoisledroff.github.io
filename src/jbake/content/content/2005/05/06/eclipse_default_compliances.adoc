Don’t we all stupidly waste time, especially when we are requested to deliver quickly ? Today I imported an subcontractor java project in my elcipse IDE, and I had an hard time figuring out why it was not compiling. So may be that small 101 type article will save someone a few minutes

It was all because of Eclipse default compliances. This java project was indeed using assertions.

Quick reminder : +
http://java.sun.com/developer/JDCTechTips/2002/tt0409.html[Assertions] are a new feature since J2SE version 1.4. An assertion is a program statement containing a boolean expression, that a programmer believes to be true at the time the statement is executed. Note you can catch assertion failures by using a catch AssertionError exception.

....
public class AssertDemo1 {
        static void f() {
            assert false;
        }
    
        public static void main(String args[]) {
            try {
                f();
            }
            catch (AssertionError e) {
                System.out.println("exception: " + e);
            }
        }
    }
....

So why is not compiling ? Well It’s because by default my IDE version (3.0.2) was using jdk1.3 compliance. I found that http://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs1706/projects/eclipseConfig.html[here]. +
So you just need to modify your preferences: Open a project in Eclipse. Select Project -> Properties -> Java Compiler -> Compliances and Classfiles, (depress the ``Use project setting'' button to activate the other tabs). Uncheck ``use default compliances'' and select 1.4 in all 3 drop down boxes.
