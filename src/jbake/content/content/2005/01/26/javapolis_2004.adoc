For the past 4 years I?ve been asking all my former managers/companies to sponsor me to attend JavaOne. As it never happened for budget or travel restrictions, I searched for cheaper and closer, and I found http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP04/Home[JavaPolis]: with an entry fee of 200 Euro, JavaPolis is ``the Apache of Conferences, low-cost and high quality!''. +

 +
Yes ! I got in ! +
 +
So first of all, thanks to François, Alain and Patrick who had to endure my incessant e.mails and phone calls until they let it/me go ! :-) So a big thanks to my official sponsor: +

 +
And a huge thanks to Stephan, http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/%7Emulkers[Robin]and the rest of the steering Members. They did a marvelous job, the conference set up was almost perfect ! +
 +
I’m really enthusiast about this event ! I came back full of energy and ideas ! +
So what is the best that came out of it ? the best was: +

* *meeting* new people, meeting bright passionate and communicative people. As I stay at the formule1 hotel near by the speakers hotel, I had the opportunity to meet with Stephan and Robin from JavaPolis steering members and then was introduced to many people, sometime quite famous, always impassioned geeks. +
* *exchanging* ideas and concepts with people all over the world all fluent in Java, it’s such a fun exercise +
* *leading* to endless conversation, even to new JSR and sometimes to endless night. +
Yes indeed ! One of my conversations, first with Stephen Colebourne and then later that night with Stephan Janssen, Joshua Bloch and Neal Gafter may lead to a new JSR. (cf. my former blog entry on http://francoisledroff.blogspot.com/2004/12/javapolis-2004-part5-bof-jodatime-by.html[Stephen Colebourne BOF] and http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP04/2004/12/29/My+own+JavaPolis+2004+experience[Stephan entry] on the javapolis wiki) +
* "**feeling** smarter for a week", as I read somewhere, on a javapolis attendee blog. +
* *sharing* impressions, lunch and sometimes diners and beers with my http://ossgtp.xwiki.com/[OSSGTP] fellows +
(Vincent Massol, Ludovic Dubost, Henry Story, Benjamin Mestrallet, Didier Girard) with my good old friend Jerome Lacoste and our new friend Robin. +
* *laughing* with _``Techno Celebs''_ around a few Duvels. Unlike http://blogs.sun.com/roller/comments/alexismp/Weblog/antwerp_diners[Alexis] and thanks to http://coffeebreaks.dyndns.org/%7Ejerome/wordpress/index.php?p=175[Jerome], I have http://francoisledroff.blogspot.com/2004/12/javapolis-2004-part15javapolis-night.html[pictures]. +
* *enjoying* geek or non-geek but always friendly moments with Didier and Jerome, in one of the finest restaurant in Anvers, http://coffeebreaks.dyndns.org/%7Ejerome/wordpress/wp-trackback.php/179[La Bourla] and with Robin at http://coffeebreaks.dyndns.org/%7Ejerome/wordpress/wp-trackback.php/168[Den Engel] +
* and the last but not least *learning* !! Yes the content was there, with not so much marketing fluff. I edited about 24 entries for the 26 presentations I attended. The 2 remaining were too bad (or marketing content only)for me to spent another minute of my time to blog about it +
