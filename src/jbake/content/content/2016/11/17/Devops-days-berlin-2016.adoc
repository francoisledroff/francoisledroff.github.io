`Chef vs. Ansible`: this was the talk Romain and I gave at https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-berlin/program/romain-pelisse/[Devops Days Berlin 2016].

It consisted in a few demos and code walk through, showing the attendees how to configure a server (including some services and a webapp) using either Chef and Ansible.
We covered the main features of each technologies, and point out both their common grounds, limitations and qualities.
The aims was also to help "troubleshoot" their issue on the selected technologies, and therefore getting out of the session an interactive tutorial.

You'll find

* link:/pdf/devopsDays-berlin-2016.pdf[or here in pdf]
* the associated Chef demo in my https://github.com/francoisledroff/devopsdayberlin2016[devopsdayberlin2016 github repo]

This `repo` was done to demo the `Chef` part (my part). Its introduces the following Chef concepts:

* Chef `nodes`
* `chef-client`
* Chef `resource`
* Chef `recipes`

* `chef-repo`
* Chef `cookbooks`
* Chef `template`
* `Ohai`

* the use of a full-blown `chef-repo` holding multiple `cookbooks`
* the user of `Berkshelf` for cookbook dependencies management
* the use of the in memory chef server called `chef-zero`
* the use of chef `provisionning` and treat our Vagrant vms as any other Chef resource using `chef/provisioning/vagrant_driver`
* the use of the `package` resource: to implement the installation of nginx

* the use of a **Chef custom `resource`** named `fat_jar`. `fat_jar` allows you to treat any given java fat jar (that is runnable jar, typically a `springboot` jar) as a resource,
; it assumes the jar is made available through a maven artifact repository
; it will donwload it
; it will configure the associated `systemd` service to run it as a service
* the configuration of nginx for it to reverse-proxy a `devopsdays` `fat_jar` http service

This was done in 4 chapters, look into the subfolders `README.md` files
