Yesterday I had the chance to present at the http://www.breizhjug.org/[BreizhJUG] (a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breton_people[Breton] Java user group) a session named http://flex.breizhjug.org/[``Flex for Java Developers'']. A crowd of almost 100 happy Java developers and architects was willing to know more about Flex.

I had an an hour and half to cover :

* a basic presentation of the flash and AIR platforms,
* cool UX flash/flex/AIR demos
* the latest great features of flash 10
* and flex, and its ecosystem from a Java developer perspective (mvn framework, testing libraries, building and quality tools, blazeds, lcds)

I ended up the session presenting https://github.com/francoisledroff/fna-v2[fna] and its maven archetypes.
I prepared some new features for this talk.
Those features are still under development but are already available in SNAPSHOT releases :

* I added flexbuilder support to some of my archetypes.
* I also upgraded the archetypes with flexmojos 2.0 support and up to the latest Flex SDK

Here is how to give the flex-library-archetype a try, (install maven-2.0.9) and use this command line

....
mvn archetype:generate  -DarchetypeVersion=1.3-SNAPSHOT
-DarchetypeGroupId=com.adobe.ac  
-DarchetypeArtifactId=flex-library-archetype 
-DarchetypeRepository=http://fna.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/fna/fna_m2_repository /
....

Build the flex library, by changing directory into your newly created flex maven project, and launch the command :

....
mvn install
....

And finally import it into your eclipse/FlexBuilder by using the import command

That’s it !

What I did is generating the .actionScriptProperties and the other FB files using the maven archetype filtering capabilities. You just have to specify a M2_REPO linked resource within eclipse to make your FB project fully fonctional. Meanwhile I’m looking forward to seeing http://docs.codehaus.org/display/M2ECLIPSE/Flex+Builder+Configuration+API[FlexBuilder support within the m2Eclipse plugin]

I also demonstrated

* Flex CC with Hudson,
* *FlexPMD* (which got a lot of interest from the third of the crowd who was already using http://pmd.sourceforge.net/[PMD])
* and AS3NCSS,

I posted some of the slides I used for the presentation on slideshare, for those of you who couldn’t make it, or simply don’t have the chance to live nearby the nice city of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennes[Rennes]. Enjoy !

PS: I just learned today (on flexmojos forum) that http://flex-mojos.info/[VELO] also published new archetypes documented there : https://docs.sonatype.org/display/FLEXMOJOS/Available+archetypes. Thanks VELO
