Last night I updated my kunbuntu from dapper to karmic using the GUI (kynaptic). At restart kde was not starting, I ended up with my the terminal mode.

I diagnostic-ed it by manually starting the Xserver

....
startx
....

I realized the system was complaining about the fglrx driver (I http://jroller.com/francoisledroff/entry/je_suis_enfin_libre[formerly installed] with Dapper on my laptop dell D610) If this happen to you too, you may fix it by doing this :

Check first your graphic card name and chipset:

....
$ lspci -nn | grep VGA
....

First removes both -fglrx and -ati, and reinstalls the latter:

....
sudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx*
  sudo apt-get remove --purge xserver-xorg-video-ati xserver-xorg-video-radeon 
  sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-ati
  sudo apt-get install --reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dri xserver-xorg-core
  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
....

Then reboot

At last edit the xorg.conf file

....
sudo vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf
....

Look for the above ``Section Device'' and change the ``Driver'' from fglrx to ati (I canâ€™t be NOT radeon either). The ``ati'' driver is a wrapper that will load the ``radeon'' driver if possible.

....
Section "Device"
        Identifier      "Radeon 9600"

        Driver          "ati"
        BusID           "PCI:1:0:0"
        Option          "XAANoOffscreenPixmaps"
EndSection
....
