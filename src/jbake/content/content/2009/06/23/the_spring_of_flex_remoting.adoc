I had the chance to present at the http://rivierajug.org[Riveria JUG] on Friday, I had one hour to cover a lot of materials. We discussed the Adobe Flash/Flex/AIR/RIA Enterprise Solutions, I also quickly demonstrated Flash Catalyst.

I also took a few minutes to demonstrate the latest http://www.springsource.org/spring-flex[spring-flex] release through a simple CRUD application named spring-flex-todo. (Beware, the client side is not production ready)

I published this demo source code within the http://code.google.com/p/fna-v2/[fna V2 project], under a LGPL V3 license :

You’ll see how elegant and easy is the Spring-Flex remoting integration; here is for example how I set up a TodoItem CRUD Flex Remoting service

....
package com.adobe.ac.samples.service.impl;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.flex.remoting.RemotingDestination;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;

import com.adobe.ac.samples.dao.TodoItemDaoJpa;

import com.adobe.ac.samples.model.TodoItem;
import com.adobe.ac.samples.service.TodoService;

@Service("todoService")
@RemotingDestination(channels = { "channel-amf" })
@Transactional
public class TodoServiceImpl extends GenericManagerImplInteger>

    implements TodoService {

    @Autowired
    public TodoServiceImpl(TodoItemDaoJpa todoItemDao) {
        super(todoItemDao);
    }

}
....

Here are the slides associated with this demo: *The Spring of Flex Remoting* :

View more http://www.slideshare.net/[Microsoft Word documents] from http://www.slideshare.net/francoisledroff[francoisledroff].

* The source code is under svn at : http://fna-v2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/riveria_jug/spring_flex_todo/
* You may import the project in your eclipse, the only prerequisites are
** have m2eclipse installed (or declare a M2_REPO linked resource within your Eclipse workspace)
** create a linked resource named spring_flex_todo_root pointing to your local copy of spring-flex-todo

For those of you who don’t like maven and would like to give this a try, I will provide a ANT version of the build as soon as one of you sends it to me. What I except from any build is to :

* be managing Dependencies
* run the XUnit-Test
* generate documentation and quality reports

So if you have a such Java/Flex ANT build, please contribute to http://code.google.com/p/fna-v2/[fna V2].

If you live near by Nice and Sophia, lucky you, be sure to check out the next http://rivierajug.org[Riveria JUG] events.
