Hunting for thread locks by creating and studying thread dumps +
 +

Lately, our latest nightly built JBoss application was hanging and eating up to 100% CPU. No deadlock per se was detected. But we definitely had some profiling to do.

There are quite a few usefull links on jboss wiki regarding http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=MonitoringManagementAndProfilingTools[Monitoring, Management, and Profiling Tools for JBoss Software]

The first options use a profiler, we first tried JProbe. It fails the 10 minutes test.

But we finally succeeded in debugging our application in a much simpler and yet efficient manner : by creating and studying thread dumps.

Here is the story:

[[jprobe-10-minutes-test-on-linux-redhat]]
link:[JProbe 10 minutes test on Linux RedHat]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

we http://www.quest.com/jprobe/profiler_freeware.asp[downloaded the JProbe community edition]. we had a few issues to make it run on top of our Linux RedHat (ES version 3) OS to profile our JBoss-3.2.6 j2ee application. The first was known and fixed by Quest, we applied a http://qlist1.quest.com/read/messages?id=12025[patch for jboss profiling]. But then the JVM crashed, I tried one or two http://java.quest.com/dist/downloads/jprobe600/doc/Readme-JProbe60.html[workarounds found in the jprobe doc], but it didn’t help.

No need to say this took me more than 10 minutes. May be, we should have tried http://labs.jboss.com/portal/index.html?ctrl:id=page.default.info&project=jbossprofiler[JBossProfiler], did you ?

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Then we found very helpfull tips on http://developers.sun.com/learning/javaoneonline/2004/newcooltech/TS-1646.pdf[javaone 2004 talk : View from the Trenches: Thread Dumps]

A Java thread dump is a log containing threads and monitors diagnostics. Depending on how complex your application is, your stack trace can range from a few lines to thousands.

On our version Jboss, we unfortunately don’t have the nice http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=GenerateAThreadDumpWithTheJMXConsole[JMX Console thread dump generation feature] starting from JBoss v3.2.8/4.0.2.

But thanks to the nice and cool http://yusuke.homeip.net/samurai/?english#content_1_8[Samurai 2.0.0] tool we did even better without. We forced the thread dump (kill -3 on Linux, Ctrl+Break on Dos), piped this dump into a text file and import it into Samurai. We found out in just a few seconds that many of our threads were endlessly waiting for JMS resources, this information lead us to the debugging path.

Note also that by just adding ``-verbose:gc'' option when launching jboss, you also get this kind of graphic for free:
