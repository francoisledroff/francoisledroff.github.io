`Hairy Security`: this was the talk Romain and I gave at http://berlin2015.codemotionworld.com/[Code Motion Berlin 2015].

For an hour we discussed many of the challenges developers face securing
 web apps (a simple Java SpringBoot app in our use case)

The key "Take away":

* Security is your responsibility
* Think about it, Threat model
* You’ll never be safe
  * nor your data
  * Encrypt !
* Manage your secrets
* Switch 2FA/strong authentication on
* UX is not an excuse for a lack of security
* Security is not an excuse for a bad UX
* Don’t forget continuous integration
* Treat your servers like cattle
* Be ready to firefight
