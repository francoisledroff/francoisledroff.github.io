Lost of maven repositories are available out there in the cloud. When you’re looking for artifacts http://www.mvnrepository.com/ is a great place to start. +
You may even find Adobe blazeDS jars referenced there. But they were not deployed there by Adobe, and they are not what I expected them to be. +
Their version number is wrong, and to me the naming and groupId as well. +
 +
It’s too bad Adobe (just like many other proprietary software editors) does not systematically provide maven repository. +
. Lots of people are asking Adobe for maven support : +

* asking for an blazeDS maven repository : http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/BLZ-71 and https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/BLZ-9
* asking for maven blazeDS archetype : https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/BLZ-44
* asking for flex maven plugin : https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-12730

 +
So to help you and me out. Here are a few ant scripts I developed yesterday to automatize and ease the creation of local and remote repository from a set of libraries. +

* first a script of reusable ant targets to ease the construction of local and remote maven repositories : maven-repository-construction-calls.xml
* then an ant script to deploy all livecycle client sdk jars into maven repository : create-LC-ES-maven-repo.xml
* and finally another ant script that target blazeds

[[maven-repository-construction-calls-from-an-ant-file]]
maven repository construction calls from an ANT file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 +
This maven-repository-construction-calls.xml ANT file of mine is the base of my maven Adobe repository creation. +
What it does is calling ``mvn install:install-file'' and ``mvn deploy:deploy-file'' through the exec ant Task. +
 +
I also develop a target called ``maven-all-artifacts-in-dir'', which iterates on all the jars in a $\{jar.directory} +
to call maven install or maven deploy on the jars that corresponds to a provided regular expression. +
This was possible thanks to the use of the very handy http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/[net.sf.antcontrib ANT tasks] and . +
 +
Here is an extract: +

[source,jive-pre]
----
"maven-all-artifacts-in-dir">
 for param="jar.file">
  
   "${jar.directory}" includes="${artifactRegexp}" />

  
 
 
 "yes" 
  property="artifactName" input="@{jar.file}" 
  regexp=".*\\([^\\]*)\.jar" select="\1" casesensitive="false" />

   "${maven.target}">
    "exec.dir" value="${jar.directory}" />
    "artifactId" value="${artifactName}" />

    "jarFileName" value="${artifactName}.jar" />

[[create-livecycle-sdk-maven-repository]]
Create LiveCycle SDK maven repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 +
This ant build file is here to help you construct your livecycle client maven repository. +
It will deploy all the jars contained in the $\{livecycle.sdk.home}/client-libs/common in your maven repositories : +
I chose to apply +

* 8.0.3187.1.156868.1 for my artifacts’ version (i.e. the version number I found in the jar manifest files)
* com.adobe.livecyle as the artifacts groupId
* the name of the jar file as an artifactId for all the files contained in the $\{livecycle.sdk.home}/client-libs/common folder
** adobe-utilities.jar is a special case : there is one for each JEE application server supported by livecycle
** I chose to use a specific artifactId for each of those :
*** jboss-adobe-utilities
*** weblogic-adobe-utilities
*** websphere-adobe-utilities

 +
Here is an extract of my build file showing how I handle the special case of adobe-utilities jars: +

[source,jive-pre]
----
"maven-livecycle-adobe-utilities">
  "groupId" value="${livecycle.groupId}" />
  "version" value="${livecycle.version}" />

  "jarFileName" value="adobe-utilities.jar" />
  "maven.repo.url" value="${maven.adobe.repo.url}" />

  "description" value="${livecycle.artifacts.description}" />
  for list="jboss,weblogic,websphere" param="livecycle.server">

   
    "maven-repository-construction-calls.xml" target="${maven-target}">
     "exec.dir" value="${livecycle.sdk.home}/client-libs/@{livecycle.server}" />

     "artifactId" value="@{livecycle.server}-adobe-utilities" />

 +
May be one day, the adobe engineering team will come with other groupId and artifact naming convention. +
I don’t know about that, those choices above are just personal/common sense, not Adobe’s official. +
 +

[[create-blazeds-maven-repository]]
Create blazeDS maven repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 +
This ant build file is here to help you construct your blazeds maven repository. +
It will deploy all the adobe jars contained in blazeds-3.0.0.544/blazeds.unzipped.war/WEB-INF/lib directory into your maven local and remote repository. +
I chose here +

* 3.0.0.544 for versioning my artifacts
* com.adobe.blazeds as the artifacts groupId
* the name of the jar file as an artifactId for all the following adobe specific jarfiles contained in blazeds-3.0.0.544/blazeds.unzipped.war/WEB-INF/lib directory:
** all the flex-something.jar files
** the cold fusion bridge : cfgatewayadapter.jar

 +

[source,jive-pre]
----
"maven-deploy-blazeds-libs">

  "maven.repo.url" value="${maven.adobe.repo.url}" />
  "description" value="${blazeds.artifacts.description}" />

  "maven-repository-construction-calls.xml" target="maven-all-artifacts-in-dir">
   "maven.target" value="maven-deploy" />
   "jar.directory" value="${blazeds.jar.dir}" />

   "artifactRegexp" value="flex*.jar" />
  
  "maven-repository-construction-calls.xml" target="maven-deploy">

   "jarFileName" value="cfgatewayadapter.jar" />
   "exec.dir" value="${blazeds.jar.dir}" />

   "artifactId" value="cfgatewayadapter" />

 +
 +
This is a different naming and versioning convention than the one chosen by the person that uploaded blazeds into ibiblio see +
http://www.mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.adobe.blazeds, but I think it’s much better my way, because it’s closer to Adobe engineering’s naming and versioning +

My Adobe maven repository is now quickly building up, and it looks like that: +
