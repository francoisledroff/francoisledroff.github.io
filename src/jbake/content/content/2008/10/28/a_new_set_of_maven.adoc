A quick announcement to let you know that Fna’s Maven archetype repository set is getting bigger.

Here is our current https://github.com/francoisledroff/fna-v2/tree/master/mvn_archetypes[list of archetypes]:

* blazeds-autowired-spring-hibernate-archetype
* flex-cairngorm-stubbed-crud-archetype
* flex-cairngorm-flexunit-archetype

And there are more to come

* a AIR localized maven archetype
* a Flex LCDS maven archetype
* …

Note that most of the new flex project archetypes make use of Cairngorm and FlexUnit.

The most complex archetype is https://github.com/francoisledroff/fna-v2/tree/master/mvn_archetypes/blazeds-autowired-spring-hibernate-archetype that I and Eric Garza will present at MAX San Francisco : http://max.adobe.com/na/sessions/browser/#552[``Flex for Java Architects''].

Blazeds-autowired-spring-hibernate-archetype helps you generate a multi-module maven project : a flex front-end application communicating with the backend through Adobe’s BlazeDS and a spring autowired service. The back-end relies on a spring hibernate architecture.

PS: http://blogs.adobe.com/xagnetti[Xavier], who helped me out on Fna is also presenting at MAX : "http://max.adobe.com/na/sessions/browser/#544[How to build collaborative applications with LCDS]".
