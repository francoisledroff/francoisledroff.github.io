Try it out ! Add my maven repository to your repositories list in your maven configuration file, *in 3 maven command lines, you’ll have a build a full professional multi-module flex blazeds spring hibernate CRUD application running on jetty* (thanks to maven and xdoclet).

This CRUD application was ``inspired'' from http://sebastien-arbogast.com/2008/04/20/flex-spring-and-blazeds-the-full-stack-epilogue/[a great article made by Sébastien Arbogast] +
Thanks Sebastien !

The flex stuff is compiled and packaged through http://blog.flex-mojos.info/[Flex Mojos]. +
Thanks Velo !
