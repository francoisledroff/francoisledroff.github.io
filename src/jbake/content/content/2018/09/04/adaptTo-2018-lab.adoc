Tired of building connectors for AEM?

Join me in my link:https://adapt.to/2018/en/schedule/build-event-driven-integrations-with-aem-using-adobe-io-events.html[AdaptTo() lab]
 where you will implement a real-time and lightweight integration with AEM with almost no code.

Come and learn how you can expose any internal osgi events from AEM through Adobe I/O Events
to build event-driven workflows across multiple systems with ease.
See how Adobe I/O Events allows you to respond to both administrative events and customer behaviors in real-time.


For you to come prepared (or for you to test it at home) I pushed on link:https://github.com/francoisledroff/adaptTo2018[the material of this lab on github].

#### Prerequisite

* an internet connection
* a text editor
* `git` installed so you can `clone` link:https://github.com/francoisledroff/adaptTo2018[my lab github repo] and `pull` it again during the lab
* An `AEM 6.4.x` instance, with administrative permissions

#### The Lab

We only have about 30/40 minutes, it will be fast, we don't expect you to complete everything:
