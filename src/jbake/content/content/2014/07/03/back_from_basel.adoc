ConnectCon (formerly known as CQCon) took place last week in Basel. It was great to connect with the CQ/AEM developers community.

I posted the slidedeck of the talk I gave with Nicolas on slideshare: http://www.slideshare.net/francoisledroff/master-chef-class-learn-how-to-quickly-cook-delightful-cqaem-infrastructures[Master Chef class: learn how to quickly cook delightful AEM infrastructures].
