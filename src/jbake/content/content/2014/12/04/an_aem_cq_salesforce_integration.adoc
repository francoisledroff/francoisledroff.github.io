I recently published on github some code we used for an Adobe IT internal AEM/CQ based app: This could help you integrating SalesForce REST API ( and SOQL queries) into your CQ/AEM instance.

For now it only supports AEM/CQ 5.5, but I welcome pull request, as well as feedback, bug fix, bug reports and comments
