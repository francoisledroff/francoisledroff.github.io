Devoxx france 2014 was an excellent vintage. The conference was packed with 1500 passionate developers.
I had the privilege to speak, hence, unlike last year, I did not see much of the show.
The first 2 days I mainly spent my time rehearsing and networking.

Here are the slides of the 40mn presentation https://twitter.com/rpelisse[Romain] and I did: https://www.slideshare.net/francoisledroff/master-chef-and-puppet-show-devoxx-france-2014[Master Chef & Puppet Show]
The video will be soon available on http://parleys.com/[parleys]

The talk was fun to prepare and run, the feedback we received was awesome. I
t was worth the effort. Romain and I agreed we should do this more often.

I spent the 3rd and last day of the conference with a cool devops gang, those guys named themself http://www.devopsmercenaries.org/[Devops Mercenaries]

Here are some of my notes (stuff I need to look at when my time and priority will allow it):

* look at ThoughtWorks’ Continuous Delivery platform, Go http://www.thoughtworks.com/news/go-continuous-delivery-now-available-as-free-open-source[as it’s been Open Sourced]
* Give a try to http://capistranorb.com/[capistrano] as a remote server automation and deployment tool (triggered by Jenkins)
* try to understand http://zookeeper.apache.org/[zookeeper] use case
* Generate code coverage report with https://github.com/sethvargo/chefspec#reporting[ChefSpec]
* have a closer look at http://serverspec.org/[serverspec], and eventually use it to audit (through serverspec logs) the automated servers
* segregate 3 types of jenkins servers: one for build (soft factory), one for QA (quality factory with Selenium, Gatling …), one for delivery/deployment
* use jenkins to launch chef automated vm and run automated integration test on these
* Do better measuring and monitoring (key to devops adoption and sponsors buy in), have a look at http://www.zabbix.com/[Zabbix], JMX, http://collectd.org/[Collectd], http://graphite.wikidot.com/[Graphite], https://code.google.com/p/javamelody/[javamelody], http://rashidkpc.github.io/Kibana/[kibana]
* Measure slack time: time allocated for devops
* Do http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html[Blue green deployment]
* nosql is helping continuous deployment, sql db automation such as liquibase and flyway do it too.
* shut down the db, without shutting down the service, that’s key too: cf https://github.com/Netflix/zuul/wiki[Netfliz zuul] solution
