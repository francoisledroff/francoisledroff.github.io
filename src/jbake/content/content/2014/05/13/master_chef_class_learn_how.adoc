As a follow-up of my talk at Devoxx France, I plan to speak at http://www.connectcon.ch/[Connect Con] in Basel the 25th and 26th of June.

This time I’ll do the talk with https://twitter.com/npeltier[Nicolas Peltier], again it will be about my new luddite practice: Chef Automation, but this time focused on CQ/Adobe Experience Manager automation.

The objective we set for ourselves is the following: show you how to start from bare metal - virtual, physical or cloud - servers and turn them, in matter of minutes, into a production ready CQ6 infrastructure.

Think author and publish farms of servers with optional SSL, dispatcher, and clustering with MongoDB.

Meanwhile you’ll be given a comprehensive overview of Chef resources and techniques enabling you to accelerate, scale up, simplify and secure your development and release workflow.

Until then if you have experience with Chef and CQ/AEM, don’t hesitate to drop me a comment/email to exchange on the subject.
